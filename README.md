**ðŸ‘‹ Hi! I'm Andre Staltz**

I'm a freelancer, working on [Manyverse](https://manyver.se), an open source app for the peer-to-peer social network [SSB](https://ssbc.github.io/scuttlebutt-protocol-guide/), funded by donations. I'm sometimes available for short gigs, workshops, talks, and consultancy.

I work with JavaScript, TypeScript, peer-to-peer networks, user interfaces, reactive programming, and React Native. I have published 300+ libraries on npm, such as [Cycle.js](https://github.com/cyclejs/cyclejs), [Callbags](https://github.com/callbag/callbag), [SSB utilities](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=ssb), [React Native utilities](https://github.com/staltz?tab=repositories&q=react-native&type=source&language=&sort=), and others.

As a writer, [my blog](https://staltz.com) has articles on open source, the future of the internet, commentary on cybereconomics, and peer-to-peer systems. This [gist](https://gist.github.com/staltz/868e7e9bc2a7b8c1f754) I wrote is very popular.
